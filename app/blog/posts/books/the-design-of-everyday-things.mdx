# CONTEXT

I've never been much of a reader and rarely finish books.
This document is a way to hold myself accountable towards becoming a better reader,
while sharing the books I discover along the way.

-   The Alchemist
-   Atomic Habits
-   Why We Sleep
-   The Design of Everyday Things (In Progress)
