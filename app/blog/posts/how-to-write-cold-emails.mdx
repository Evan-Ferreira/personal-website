# CONTEXT

I saw an excellent tweet from my friend <a href="https://x.com/liam_builds/status/1982984818527973621" className="underline">Liam</a>,
that cold emailing is the fastest way to get ahead as a young person – I 100% agree.

I've sent hundreds of cold emails throughout my undergrad. In fact, every job I had during undergrad has come
from a cold email. Cold emails have opened so many doors for me, that I wouldn't have thought possible. This article is a way for me to give
back to anyone else who wants to break down any barriers to do cool shit.

# WHY COLD EMAIL?

Most have us have heard of the concept of <a href="" className="underline">six degrees of separation</a>, the idea that you
can reach anyone through 6 continuous points of contact. I think in 2026 this is no longer the case; anyone in the world
is now 1-2 degrees of separation away, max. In the age of the internet, everyone's contact information can be found online, and often for free.
If you have access to Jeff Bezos' email address, what's stopping you from reaching him?

# INTRODUCTION

The best people at cold emailing I've met also had an excellent understanding of sales. Which makes sense, every cold outbound message that you
send has an ask, therefore, every cold email sent you're either selling something or yourself. Therefore, the rules of sales apply. These are 6 rules
from selling that I've adapted for cold emailing.

- Introduce yourself
- Build rapport
- Have an ask
- Have a value proposition
- Personalize, personalize, personalize
- Keep it concise

# COLD EMAIL WALKTHROUGH

Whenever anyone asks me for my cold email template, I always tell them the same thing: I don't have one. Every cold email I send varies greatly for each other.
Like a stereotypical business student, I don't use a formula, I use a framework. There are some general guidelines that are fairly concrete follow,
but the rest is a free-for-all. When your learning to cold email, it's a science. To get from good to great, it becomes an art.

This is a real email I've sent that landed me an internship. Why did this work? Let's break down the 3 main sections of the email.

# BUILDING RAPPORT

> **Acquired Queen's Commerce Student Founder Interested in [Company Name]**
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> My name is Evan, I'm in my 3rd year of Queen's Commerce, passionate about software and startups.
>
> A couple of months ago, I read <span className="underline">an article</span> that [Company Name] promoted you to [Position] (congrats!!).
> It's amazing to hear that a Canadian and Ivey grad has been a driving force at [Company Name]. :)

Starting from the subject line, this is where you want to start building rapport by finding commonality between you and the receipent. Treat building rapport as trying to
convert your cold email into a warm email as fast as possible. This can come in many forms:

- Mention a shared alma mater (high school, university, sports team, etc.)
- Compliment them being featured in recent publicity
- Compliment them on a recent achievement

> **Acquired Queen's Commerce Student Founder Interested in [Company Name]**

Here, I mentioned that I'm a Queen's Commerce student and an acquired founder. The person I was emailing was an Ivey grad (Ivey & Queen's are rival business schools in Canada) and
a past founder.

Your subject line is the first thing that they receipient will see, most likely as a push notification on their phone. Given this, keep your subject line relatively concise
so it can be easily be read by glancing at a phone and makes them want to open your email, so really try to build rapport.

Your subject line is the first thing that the recipient will see, typically notification on their phone. Make it short, easy to read at a glance, and compelling enough
that they want to open your email.

> Hi [Name],
>
> My name is Evan, I'm in my 3rd year of Queen's Commerce, passionate about software and startups.

Introduce yourself:

- What's your name?
- Are you a student or a professional? Where do you work or go to school and what's your position?
- What's your background or interests and how does it relate to what you're going to ask for? (Keep this to a couple words max)

> A couple of months ago, I read <span className="underline">an article</span> that [Company Name] promoted you to [Position] (congrats!!).
> It's amazing to hear that a Canadian and Ivey grad has been a driving force at [Company Name]. :)

Expand on the commonality you used in your subject line and be authentic. If you genuinely think something they did is impressive, tell them!

# VALUE PROPOSITION

> Recently, I took a gap year after <span className="underline">Taiv (YC W20) acquired my startup</span>. During that time, I led an engineering team to build internal tooling for their sales and ops teams, where I found my passion for software engineering.

Through building rapport, you've got their attention. Before asking them for whatever you're about to askk for, you need to give them a reason to say "yes". This is where your
value proposition comes in.

Your value proposition needs to be tailored to your ask and the person you're emailing. In this case, I'm emailing for a software engineering internship and the person I'm emailing is an
ex-founder. I chose to talk about my acquired startup alongside building internal tooling from the ground up because it shows my entrepreneurial ability (something this specific person
would find of partiuclar value) and demonstrates that I have strong technical ability, so I'm good a fit for the role.

# THE ASK

> I saw that [Company Name] Toronto office opened a Summer SWE Internship, and I would love to be in consideration. I deeply resonate with [Company Name] fast-paced and high-agency culture.
>
> If possible, I'd greatly appreciate an introduction to someone on [Company Name]'s talent team to see if I'd be a good fit. I've attached my resume in case it's helpful.

Be explicit with what you're asking for. Personally, I always make sure that I have my ask is it's own paragraph so there's no ambiguity about what I want.

Minimize their time commitment. Chances are the person you're emailing has a packed schedule. In this case, I'm asking for an introduction, not an interview or a job.
All I'm asking for is 15 seconds for them to forward my email to the right person. If you're asking for a coffee chat, ask for 15 minutes, not 30. Once you're on the call, then you can
ask if they have more time to go-over or if you can schedule a longer call.

Whenever you're reaching out cold, you don't have enough of a relationship to ask for something huge upfront. Have a small ask, build a relationship, and then follow up with a
warm email/message.

Also, note that I've attached my resume upfront. Any time your asking for a job, their second email will be to ask for your resume.

Reduce any points of friction and back-and-forth. It's hard to get someone to respond once P(First Response), getting them to respond twice P(Second Response) after sending in your
resume as signfiicantly decreased your chances of getting a response overall P = P(First Response) \* P(Second Response).

# GENERAL GUIDELINES

- Optimize for mobile view
- Paragraphs are 1-2 sentences, max
- Keep it concise
- Use exclamation marks
- Show emotion and be authentic
- Be respectful and grateful
- Your greeting should be "Hi [Name],"
- Your sign-off should be "Best,"
- Flex 1-2 accomplishments, max
- Include your intention in the subject
- Personalize! Why did you email them?

# FINAL THOUGHTS

I want to re-iterate that this isn't a formula, it's a framework, meaning use this as a guide, rather than a hard set of rules. Many of my emails, I'll deviate from the structure I've shown
above. For example, if I'm emailing someone who's busier, I might talk about commonality before introducing myself, to increase the odds the continue reading and finsih the email:

> Hi [Name],
>
> A couple of months ago, I read <span className="underline">an article</span> that [Company Name] promoted you to [Position] (congrats!!). It's amazing to hear that a Canadian and Ivey grad has been a driving force at [Company Name]. :)
>
> My name is Evan, I'm in my 3rd year of Queen's Commerce, passionate about software and startups.

Experiment. A/B test. Once you have a basic understanding of cold emailing, start adding/changing your structure. Figure out what works best for which ask and for what people.

I hope you found this guide helpful. If you end up finding success cold emailing, feel free to shoot me a (cold) email – I'd love to hear about it :).
